24. How the Web works:
 user enter some url.com to browser=>Domain Loop => send request to server
 => Backend handle the requests(reaching to database)
 => then, server sends response back to the user.
 Request and response done in protocol, http or https

 25. Creating a Node Server
 Core Modules: http-launch a server, send request
 https - launch a SSL server,fs,path,os

 To create a server: const sth= require('http')
 const server = sth.createServer((req,res)=>{

 })
 server.listen(3000)//go to the browser enter localhost:3000 to see the output
 in the terminal

 26***. The Nodejs Lifecycle and Event Loop
 node app.js => Start Script => Parse code, register varibale and function
 =>then enter Event loop(server keep listenning to the req)
 Because the event is registered, so it keep running
 Nodejs handle the server and execute one thread on our computer
 Nodejs uses event loop concept where it always keep on running
 and just executes when a certain event occurs.
 Therefore, it keeps running to get the requests. 
 In OS, it leverages os in multithread
 process.exit to stop listenning

 28.Understand Requests
 console.log(req.url, req.method) and so on to see the request.
 29. Sending Responses
 res.write to write html code. 
 res.end after this, we don write any more
 in browser ctrl+shift I, check the network to see details
 RELOADS and run node app.js everytime we update thing.

 30READ. Request and Response Headers
 On both requests and responses, Http headers are added to transport metadata from A to B.
The following article provides a great
 overview of available headers and their role: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers

 31. Routing Requests(connect req and res)
 check if the req.url matches with "/", if so, write the response

 32. Redirecting requests
 if (url ==='/message' && method ==='POST'){
        // redirect user 
        fs.writeFileSync('message.txt','DUMMY',{});
         res.writeHead(302,"inside writeHead", {'Location':'/'});
        // res.statusCode = 302;
        // res.setHeader('Location','/');
        return res.end();
redirect to the same page, check status 302.

33.Parsing Request Bodies(Stream & Buffer)
Stream is an on going process, request is read by node in chunk
To organize income chunk, use Buffer. Buffer like bus stop, allow you to hold multiple chunk
Get request data. req.on('data', (chunk)=>{
        body.push(chunk); //push a new element on the body.

})
req.on('end',()=>{
        const parseBody = Buffer.concat(body).toString();
})
34. Understanding Event Driven Code Execution.
sending response does not mean event listener are dead
it just called back to req.on(end) to be called sometimes in the future.
Therefore it won't get execute. 

35.Blocking and Non-Blocking Code
writeFileSync(file,): will block code execution until the file is created.
use writeFile instead: because accept the path, and it's asynchronous. So, other code can get executed.
36. Looking Behind the scene
Node uses single JS Thread
Event Loop automatically start Event Loop(Handle Event Callbacks)
fs sent to worker Pool(handle long file, have many threads)
when worker is done, trigger callback to Event Loop.
The Event Loop: keep the process running, handle all the callback
check any timeout, check pending I/O, Poll(retrieve new I/O)
Poll check any Timeout or I/O
setImmediate get execute after finished open callbacks.
Close callback: execute all 'close' event callbacks.
if there no event handler, process.exit
37. Using Node module system.
create routes.js
cut all the logic put into routes.js
create requestHandler to wrap all the logic
in routes: module.exports = {
        handler: requestHandler
}
in app.js: require routes 
const routes = require('./routes');
38. Wrap up**********************
How the web works: Client => Request => Server => Response=> Client
Program Lifecycle: Nodejs run non-Blocking code and use event loop running logic
A Node program exits as soon as there is no more work to do
createServer() never finishes by default
Request& response: parse request data in chunks, Stream and Buffer
CoreModules: http, fs, path.... 
use require("module") to import
module.exports to export

###############Section 4: Improved Development Workflow and Debugging**************
41. Understand Npm Scripts
in commanline, enter npm init, fill in the fields till finish.
This will create a package.json.
42. Installing 3rd party packages(COMES BACK HERE******)
Your project
Core Node Packages(http, fs....)
Dependencies(3rd): express, body-parser....
44. Using Nodemon for Autorestarts
in package.js, modify "start": "nodemon app.js"
46. Understanding errors
Syntax Errors, Runtime Errors, Logical Errors.
47. Finding syntax errors
48. Runtime error 
look at the error message in cmd and check the code
49. Logical error
50.
51.

################Section 5: Working with Express.js#################
57. What is Express.js?
It makes easy to install another package. 
We focus on Business Logic. Use a Framework for Heavy Lifting!
Alternatives to Expressjs: Vanila Node.js, Adonis.js, Koa, Sails.js 
58. Installing Express.js
npm install --save express
in app.js
const express = require("express")
const app = express()
....createServer(app)
59. Adding middleware
Req-> Middleware->Middleware->Response
split code into multiple blocks, 
app.use(req,res,next) =>{

}
60. How Middleware works
either calling next() or response
We traveling from middleware to middleware, from top to bottom
61. Look Behind the scene
use app.listen(3000)
replace const server = http.createServer();
server.listen(3000)
62.handling routes
put MORE SPECIFIC URL ON THE TOP************
app.use('/url',(rrn)=>{
        res.send or next
})
63.Parsing Incoming Requests
npm install --save body-parser
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: true});
64. Limiting Middleware Execution to POST Requests
app.post to fileter incoming post req
app.get  //                    get
we have app.path,......
65. Using Express Router
break our logic into different function
add routes folder, shop.js, and admin.js 
put app.use related product into admin. and '/' to shop.js
import express for each file, express.Router, and export.

66. Adding a 404 Error page
app.use((req,res,next) => {
    res.status(404).send('<h1>Page not found</h1>');
})

67. Filtering Paths
Add /admin, adminRoutes
in admin.js, add to form admin/add-product

68.Create HTML page.
Views folder, add-product.html and shop.html

69.Serving HTML page
in shop.js, import path by require('path')
use res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname,"Views","shop.html"))
70. Return page 404 not found
in Views, create pageNotFound.html
in app.js res.status(404.sendFile(__dirname,"Views","pageNotFound.html"))

71. Using a Helper Funtion for Navigation
use .. instead of ../
Create utils folder
path.js
module.exports = path.dirname(process.mainModule.filename);
in adminjs and shopjs, replace __dirname, "../" with dirROOT, imported on the top from utils/path
